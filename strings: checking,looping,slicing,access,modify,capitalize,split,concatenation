#Python strings: 
#They are text and it is surrounded by double/single quotes.
x = "Hello! how are you?"
print(x)


#Get the type: 
print(type(x))


#Length of a string: 
print(len(x))


#Access the string: 
y="hello!"
print(y[4])


#Looping through a string: 
for x in "caterpillar":
    print(x)


#Checking a string: 
text = "i love cats ."
print("cats" in text)


#Slicing string:
b = "watermelon"
print(b[0:5])
c = "programming"

#negative indexing:
v="laura"
-1 -2 -3 -4
